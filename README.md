# Power BI Project – Data Professional Survey

Hi! 👋 This project is about analyzing survey data collected from data professionals across the world. I used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that shows insights about job roles, salaries, tools used, work locations, and more.

## 📁 Files in this Repository

- `Data_Professional survey_Project.pbix` – This is the Power BI dashboard file.
- `Data_Set.xlsx` – This is the Excel file that contains the survey data.

## 📊 What’s in the Dashboard?

The dashboard includes:
- Job roles of data professionals
- Popular tools and programming languages used
- Salary trends by country and job role
- Work setup (remote, hybrid, on-site)
- Education background and certifications

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI
- Microsoft Excel (for the dataset)

## 🧠 How to View This Project

1. Download both files from this GitHub repo.
2. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
3. If it asks for the Excel path, connect the `Data_Set.xlsx` again.
4. That’s it! Explore the visuals and insights.
